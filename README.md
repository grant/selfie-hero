## Install Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install CocoaPods with the command `gem install cocoapods`. If you are using the default Ruby on OS X, you will need to use sudo with this command.
3. Open app.xcworkspace (*not app.xcodeproj, it does not link Pods in the build chain*)
4. If you want to add additional frameworks, just go to the Podfile, add in the name of the Pod you want to install (go to [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) to find their names), and then type `pod install` in the directory.
